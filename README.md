## How to clone

My code is pretty rough - oops - as it is, this codebase is not really suited for cold cloning, but you can make it work if you want it to ;]

You can make your own pstraw-style site by adding your TMDB credentials to the .env file (`cp .env.example .env`). You can get your credentials from the TMDB website. The `slurpi` directory contains the code which sucks down TMDB data. The TMDB data is based on favorites only.
