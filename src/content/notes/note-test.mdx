## Paragraph Stuff

Here is some text in a regualr paragraph. We also have some **bold stuff**, and then we have as well some _italic stuff_ (we don't actually have italic support in the main font, so we are using the mono font stack). After all of the bold and italic stuff, we've got some ~~strikethrough stuff~~. I think that pretty much covers all of the vanilla paragraph embelishments.

## Code Stuff

Below is a code block example. Right here is `an inline code example`. We can do most langauges here, too! The `pre` element even comes with a `data-language` attribute in case we want to add any fancy images.

```js
const wow = "this is a js code block";
let this = "sweet";

for (let cool = 0; cool < 9999; cool++) {
  console.log(`this is ${cool} cool!!`);
}
```

## Image Stuff

This is the whole reason I made this note - to test out images! We'll get there some day...
