## What's happening in September 2025

Not tons going on this month - the site has been stable and in a good spot, so I've been enjoying using it to track movie watches. There was a good dedicated server deal on OVH so I decided to ditch the VPS and get a dedicated server for less money. So far, everything is working great - there's lots of resources compared to the VPS so I've tested out a couple game servers and am currently enjoying a no-build-cost valheim playthrough.

As everybody knows...with game servers comes gamedig server status code! I added `gamedig` and `node-cron` to get some simple server status queries up. I didn't want to do anything too fancy, so I made a minimal `GameServers` component and popped it in the footer after the logo ðŸ˜‹

Lysander had another ear infection, so we're currently working through a bottle of ear medicine one squirt at a time. The new vet I took him to was really funny. Other than that, things are just chugging along. The next planned code update is the "movie refresh" feature via the admin server - this will add a new date field to the Movie and Show schemas which the recently-watched list(s) can pull from - if a movie has already been watched, it can be "refreshed" and appear on the recent list again.

That's all! Hope your September was good - I'll check back in soon.
