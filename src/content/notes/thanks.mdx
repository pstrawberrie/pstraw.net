## Thank You!
Wow - where to start, RIGHT?! When I was young I thought that I was soooo independent and I made my own destiny ([destiny is all!](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/63333-the-last-kingdom)). Once I got older, I realized that I would probably just be dead in a sewer without everybodys' help. I spent some time thinking about just how much help is necessary to get through life, and how wrong I had been that I did everything on my own. It was a very important realization when I finally understood that nobody can survive without help - it's a basic necessity. This page is dedicated to all of the people who have helped me to survive and create things. **THANK YOU!!!!**

### Family
I'm very lucky to have a supportive family. My parents tought me by action that even if you don't share hardcore, fundamental beliefs with somebody, you can still support them and help them to do great things. So obviously, my first thanks is going to my family for helping me survive and teaching me how to be a decent person.

### Friends
Friends have been a huge part of my life! Whether it's making things for my friends, making things with my friends, or making things to impress my friends, I've always snatched inspiration from my friends. I'm working on creating pages for friends, but it's going to take forever, so for now this is my thanks to all of you friends!
